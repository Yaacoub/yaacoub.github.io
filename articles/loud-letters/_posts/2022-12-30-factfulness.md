## Introduction

It's rare to find a non-fiction book easy to read and engaging, but that's what Hans Rosling, Ola Rosling, and Anna Rosling Rönnlund have achieved with [*Factfulness*](https://www.gapminder.org/factfulness-book/). This book fundamentally changed how I see the world and my place in it. I've learned so much that I can't help but share my notes and highlights with you so you can grasp the contents and eventually read the book yourself.

The book starts interestingly with Hans Rosling's love for sword swallowing and a quiz testing the reader on his understanding of the world. I won't be sharing the questions or the correct answers with you here, so you'll have to check out the book to take the quiz. Nonetheless, here are my answers to the single-choice quiz so you can compare your answers with mine.

## Conclusion

*Factfulness* is written in a friendly, non-judgmental way and is full of interesting facts and insights. I found myself maniacally highlighting phrases and sentences. It's not just a book on statistics but about how our brains see the world as worse than it is in reality.
