Peter Yaacoub built the Christmas Guide app as a freemium app.

Throughout the privacy policy, the term Service will refer to Christmas Guide. The first-person singular pronouns will refer to the developer Peter Yaacoub.

This page informs the user regarding my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use the Service.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using the Service, I may require the user to provide me with certain personally identifiable information. The Service will retain the information that I request on the user's device, and I won't collect it in any way.

## Log Data

Whenever the user uses the Service, in case of an error, I collect data and information (through third-party products) on the user's phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include the user's operating system version, the Service's settings, the time and date, and other statistics.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data, commonly used as anonymous and unique identifiers. The Service does not use these cookies explicitly. However, the Service may use third-party code and libraries or link to sites that use cookies to collect information and improve their services. The user has the option to either accept or refuse these cookies.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. Note that I do not operate these external links. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, I advise users to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify users of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
