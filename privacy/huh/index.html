            <p>
                <strong>This Privacy Policy was last updated on March 2, 2019.</strong>
                <br><br>
                "Huh?" is a free application developed by Peter Yaacoub, provided at no cost and intended for use as is.
                <br><br>
                This page is used to inform visitors regarding the policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of information if anyone decided to use this service.
                <br><br>
                If you decide to use this service, then you agree to the collection and use of data relative to this policy. The collected information, used for providing and improving the service, will not be used, nor shared with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
    
            <br><br>
            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <br><br>
    
            <p>
                Privacy is as valuable as the anonymity of the gathered information. The collection of this anonymous and unidentifiable information only occurs while the application is open in the foreground.
                <br><br>
                The gathered information is:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>All the previously looked up words and the dictionary used to complete each search. These are used to determine the popularity of an individual word, a dictionary's reputation, and to promptly find any faults or flaws.</li>
                    <li>The method used to open a previously searched word, stored in history. The first method is accessibility from the home screen while the second is from the history section and this information is collected to identify their average usage rate and the required changes to make in future versions of "Huh?".</li>
                    <li>The selected theme and language every time "Huh?" launches. This information is collected to identify a language's popularity and each theme's average usage rate.</li>
                    <li>The country, the device and its operating system are part of the anonymously collected information. New languages and device support are, in part, determined by this information.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                Authorised third-party services may have access to the unidentifiable and anonymous data that is collected and may also collect information used to identify you.
