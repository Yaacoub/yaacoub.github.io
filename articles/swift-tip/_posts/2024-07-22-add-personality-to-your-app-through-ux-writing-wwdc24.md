## Personality, Voice, and Tone

Personality in an app can be expressed through four main elements: colors, fonts, illustrations, and writing. This article will focus specifically on how writing contributes to your app's personality.

## Understanding Voice and Tone

Voice represents the brand’s core values and identity through language. Tone, on the other hand, adapts this voice to suit different situations and contexts. For instance, a progress-tracking app might use playful language and exclamation marks to match its cheerful design.

## Practical Application

Following Apple's exercises for defining voice, I applied this approach to several of my apps. Here’s a breakdown of the adjectives I used to describe the personality of each app.

## Conclusion: To Be or To App

When crafting UX writing for your app, prioritize clarity and inclusivity, steer clear of jargon, and infuse personality by imagining your app as a character with its own voice. A fun tip from my experience: I name my apps—Nicolas, Robert, and Benoit—to reflect their unique personalities and roles.
