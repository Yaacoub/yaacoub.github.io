## XVIII - The Audience

### Vocabulary

## XIX - The Diversion

> It is half-way between the argumentum ad personam […] and the argumentum ad hominem.

* That time deprives a universal opinion of its demonstrative force.
* That distance deprives a universal opinion of its demonstrative force.

## XXXIV - The Urge

> You have, as it were, reduced him to silence.

If your opponent evades your question or argument by a counter-question or indirect answer, trying to turn the subject, you have hit a weak spot. Urge the point all the more and don’t let your opponent evade it.

To overcome this tactic, you can quietly reply that your opponent’s answer has no bearing on the point in dispute. To prevent this tactic, don’t show your opponent that he is wrong. He would rather be insulted than proven wrong.
