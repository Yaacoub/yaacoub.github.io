title: "Brief Answers to the Big Questions"
---

## Introduction

> Newton gave us answers. Hawking gave us questions. And Hawking’s questions themselves keep on giving, generating breakthroughs decades later.

I finished reading this timeless book by Stephen Hawking exactly 1 year and 1 month ago. However, the time span didn’t remove its impact on my mind. I had never taken so many notes for a single book, but the quantity and the quality of words, sentences, and references were at the same level as the impact of his ideas. That is to say, everything was diligently thought-out.

**Abhorent** = Inspiring disgust and loathing.  
**Entropy** = Lack of order or predictability.  
**Eulogy** = A tribute to someone who has just died.  
**Memorialize** = Preserve the memory of.  
**Wow** = Impress and excite someone greatly.

## Why we must ask the big questions

> While there's life, there is hope.

**Atrophy** = Waste away as a result of degeneration of cells.  
**Daft** = Silly, foolish.  
**Fellowship** = Status of a fellow of a college or society.
